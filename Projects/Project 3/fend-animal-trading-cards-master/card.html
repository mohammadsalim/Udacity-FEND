			<p>Wolves are the largest members of the Canidae family, which includes domestic dogs, coyotes, dingoes, African hunting dogs, many types of foxes, and several kinds of jackals. They were once the most widely distributed land predator the world has ever seen. The only places they didn’t thrive were in the true desert and rainforests. Under certain conditions, wolves can hear as far as six miles away in the forest and ten miles on the open tundra.</p>
