# You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?

*But you're not unfamiliar with this game, Salim.*

Themes of **self-doubt**, **lack of confidence**, and **time** itself will cripple your ability to do what's necessary. Three days left, two, maybe only hours remain before the next looming deadline. There's no ocarina of time and its song of reverse time to help you, only you and the code in front of you. It feels like you're repeating the same three days over and over, and it's because in a way you are. Failure and mistakes come in different forms.

*It should not break your spirit*

**You're going to fail, often.** From small syntax errors throwing off a function to breaking an entire database with a type-o. It's what you do with those failures, under that pressure that truly separates you from a being a good developer and being a **great** developer.

*Learn from your mistakes, have patience and ask questions.*

Turn your perspective from being stuck in a hole into being part of a challenge. **How did you get here?** Okay, what thought process did I have that allowed this to occur? Has this happened to other people? How did they fix it? How can I fix it with what I now know? **By understanding how to diagnose the problem you open doors to finding a solution**, and more importantly think more critically in the future so as to not repeat the same mistake. You've always been a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. Like Elliot Alderson so gently put it: **_“Most coders think debugging software is about fixing a mistake, but that’s bullshit. Debugging is actually all about finding the bug, about understanding why the bug was there to begin with, about knowing that its existence was no accident.”_** This nugget of wisdom transcends beyond just code, sometimes the bug is mental, or something else blocking you from progressing in growth and learning.

*Utilize the resources around you.*

You might not have a magical ocarina, or the Triforce of courage, or even a wicked cool sword. But like the Hero of Time you are not on this journey alone. Bugs in code or even facing a roadblock when learning something new in a specific language is an essential part of the development process. You are lucky enough to be both an alumni of **General Assembly** and a current member of the **Udacity nano-degree program**. An army of developers with a repertoire of skills ranging with diversity is at your disposal. It's a team effort. Reach out to someone, chances are they've experienced what you're going through or know who/ what to point to that might be a better help.

There's also the most underrated developer in the industry, **yourself!** Remember those all-nighters you spent building a ruby app from the ground up? Only to realize you didn't link the postgreSQL database properly, or your facebook omniauth login wasn't working for some reason because of a gem? Remember the compromises you had to make at 7AM to get the app working, **1 hour** before you had to take the train to make it it time for your presentation in class? The anxiety you had the night before dispersing as you showed your instructor the error you were getting and you realized why? You made it through that. You persevered and learned how to keep yourself zen in such a high stress moment. Those are experiences that will keep you strong in the future. You're not alone.

Also, there's this neat thing that exists called the *internet*, which is chock full of nifty resources such as **stackoverflow**, **gitHub**, or **codeacademy** to name a few. All it takes a is a simple Google search.

## Set some goals

Needless to say, you're part of this industry now. You may be struggling with your confidence as a developer, but that's because you're not exposed to a development environment consistently. You're not interacting with other devs on a daily basis. Like when leaving Kokiri Forest for the first time and entering the fast fields of Hyrule, it'll be **intimidating**. Despite that, I want to see you land a full-time web development gig! It's the path to success. Attend more **hackathons**, stay up to date with your alumni peers on what technologies they're using. Finishing your nano-degree with **Udacity** is one of the biggest stepping stones to achieving that. Right now as you write this your contract at your current job is ending at the end of July. You're filled with both anxiety and relief. Anxious because this was a stable job, without it the bills would stack up. Relieved because it's the push you needed to leave a place with no growth, working in an industry you don't feel passionate about. You have the experience of a full stack web developer under your belt thanks to completing General Assembly, **stay the course** with Udacity and earn a job in a career that you know will make you happy.

Good luck champ, **you can do it**.
