You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* I have learned several new elements to utilize in HTML. I used to rely on css to accomplish some of things i can now easily do right from HTML. Notably the superscript/ subscript elements and horizontal rule.

* Repetition is key, with HTML that remains true. It has become a natural part of writing with more practice, much more easier to call upon new found elements and skills when you do it frequently enough.

* Given that I personally already have a background in Web Development, I find it hard to restrain from using CSS and JS to make these projects look dynamic, excited to move forward in the course!

* Using online resources such as Mozilla and W3 is a blessing for overcoming challenges. All it takes is a simple google search to arm ones self with invaluable information.
